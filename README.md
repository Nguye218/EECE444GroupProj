# EECE444GroupProj

This was a final lab to test our group work skills and all of our coding skills that we have learned in our classes in the past year. The assignment was to create a function generator that can toggle between pulse train and sine wave. The secondary objective was to work as a group and complete all tasks in a timely manner while communicating efficiently.
